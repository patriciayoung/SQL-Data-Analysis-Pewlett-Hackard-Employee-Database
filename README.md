# SQL Data Analysis: Pewlett Hackard Employee Database

# Overview:
As a newly onboarded data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, this project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the company's employee database spanning the 1980s and 1990s. Employing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis techniques, this initiative delves into six CSV files to reconstruct and scrutinize the historical employee database.

# Objective:
The project aims to achieve three primary objectives:

Data Modeling: Develop tables to accommodate data from the CSV files, creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize table relationships.
Data Engineering: Construct a table schema for each CSV file, delineating data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Import the CSV files into a SQL database.
Data Analysis: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to address specific inquiries regarding employee data.

# Methodology:
Data Modeling:
Examined CSV files and utilized QuickDBD to draft an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), delineating table relationships.

Data Engineering:
Developed table schemas for each of the six CSV files, ensuring data integrity by defining data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
Imported data from CSV files into corresponding SQL tables, preserving the relational structure outlined in the ERD.
Data Analysis:
Executed SQL queries to extract employee information such as employee numbers, names, gender, salaries, hire dates, department managers, department numbers, and names.
Identified employees hired in 1986, employees named Hercules with surnames starting with "B", employees in Sales and Development departments, and computed frequency counts of employee last names.

# Key Findings:
Successfully reconstructed Pewlett Hackard's employee database from the 1980s and 1990s.
Uncovered crucial employee data points, including salary details, departmental assignments, and managerial hierarchies.
Provided insights into hiring patterns, departmental compositions, and prevalence of specific last names among employees. Certain analysis queries were intricate, necessitating joins across multiple tables. Strategic utilization of SQL functions and meticulous query planning ensured precise and efficient data retrieval.

# Conclusion:
This project underscores the adaptability of SQL in managing and analyzing extensive datasets. Through careful planning and execution, we have furnished Pewlett Hackard with invaluable insights into their historical employee data, empowering informed decision-making grounded in comprehensive data analysis.
