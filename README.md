EmployeeSQL contains 2 SQL files (employee_tables.sql) and ( ): 
	1. employee_tables.sql - file builds builds and creates the tables that hold employees 		related data from imported civ files. Relationships are defined between tables and columns 	using primary keys, foreign keys, and composite keys.
	
	2. 

Background: conduct research on employees working in 80's and 90's at company. Only data remaining are 6 CSV files

Objs: project consists of designing tables that will hold CSV data, import CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about data.

1. Data Modeling
2. Data Engineering
3. Data Analysis

Data Modeling: after inspecting CSV files, create ERC using Quick Database Diagrams.

Data Engineering: Create table schema for each of the CSV files with specific data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. (Hint: import data in same order as corresponding tables got created. Remember to account for the headers when doing the imports.)
